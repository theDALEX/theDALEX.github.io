        description: "This research came from my belief that people often stop at surface level information instead of looking deeper. I believe everything is connected, and when we examine issues thoroughly, we see that wealth inequality is not accidental but structurally justified. This is my first research project, so if you identify any issues, please bring them to my attention.",
